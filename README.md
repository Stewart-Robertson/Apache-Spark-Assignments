# Apache-Spark-Assignments

This is a collection of assignnments completed via UC San Diego on EdX.

This was the final class in the Data Science "Micromasters" course offered by UC San Diego.

The class was taught by Professor Yoav Freund, the co-creator of the AdaBoost algorithm and these programming assignments constituted the bulk of the work.

A summary of the assignments is as follows:

1. Finding all sets of collinear points in an arbitrary set of coordinates using Spark
2. Analysis of tweet data using Spark - first locally on 10MB of data, then using HDFS via AWS EMR and 10GB of data
3. Calculation of statistics to be used in a manual implementation of PCA where the data has NaNs present
4. Using KMeans clustering to estimate the intrinsic dimension of a dataset
5. Comparing the classification accuracy and implementation of Gradient Boosted Trees and Random Forests to predict the type of tree cover for an area,
and use this to classify the geographical location
6. Using XGBoost to classify, with 80% confidence interval via bootstrapping, the species of whale that generated a given echo-location click
7. Using TensorFlow to create a Neural Network and analyse particle data from the Large Hadron Collider with the goal of detecting the Higg's Boson
